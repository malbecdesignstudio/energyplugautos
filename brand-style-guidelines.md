# EnergyPlug Autos - Revised Brand Style Guidelines (Enhanced Detail)

**Introduction**

Welcome to the EnergyPlug Autos Brand Style Guidelines. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for maintaining a consistent and professional brand identity across all communications and materials. Consistency is crucial for building a recognizable, trustworthy, and impactful brand. These guidelines outline the core elements of our brand and provide clear instructions for their correct application. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a unified and strong brand experience for every customer and partner interacting with EnergyPlug Autos.

**1. Logo Usage**

**1.1 Primary Logo:**

*   **(Insert EnergyPlug Autos Primary Logo Here - *Placeholder for the actual logo file in SVG or high-resolution PNG format, e.g., [EnergyPlug_Autos_Primary_Logo.svg]*)**
*   This is the primary EnergyPlug Autos logo. It is the cornerstone of our visual identity and should be used in all standard applications.
*   Always use the official, high-resolution logo files. Do not attempt to recreate or alter the logo design.

**1.2 Logo Variations:**

*   **(Insert EnergyPlug Autos Logo Variations Here - *Placeholders for logo variations if they exist in SVG or high-resolution PNG format, e.g., [EnergyPlug_Autos_Logo_Horizontal.svg], [EnergyPlug_Autos_Logo_Vertical.svg], [EnergyPlug_Autos_Logo_Monochrome.svg]*)**
*   **Horizontal Logo:**  Use for website headers, email signatures, and wide format applications where horizontal space is dominant.
*   **Vertical Logo:** Use for sidebars, app icons (if applicable), and applications where vertical space is dominant.
*   **Monochrome Logo (Grey, White, Black):** Use for single-color applications, engravings, embroidery, or when color reproduction is limited. Choose the monochrome version that provides the best contrast against the background.

**1.3 Logo Clear Space:**

*   To maximize visual impact and legibility, the logo must always be surrounded by a minimum clear space, free of any other visual elements (text, graphics, images).
*   The minimum clear space should be equal to **1/2 the height of the logo** (measured from the top of the tallest element to the bottom of the lowest element). If the logo features a distinct symbol, use 1/2 the height of the symbol as the clear space minimum.
*   **(Visual Example: [EnergyPlug_Autos_Logo_Clear_Space.png] - *Placeholder for visual illustration of clear space rule. The visual should clearly show the logo with a marked clear space area around it, demonstrating how to measure the minimum space.*)**
*   *Visual should clearly show the logo with a marked clear space area around it, demonstrating how to measure the minimum space.*

**1.4 Logo Minimum Size:**

*   To ensure continued legibility and brand recognition, the logo should not be reproduced below the specified minimum sizes.
*   **Minimum Width (Web):** 100 pixels
*   **Minimum Width (Print):** 0.75 inches (19 mm)
*   **(Visual Example: [EnergyPlug_Autos_Logo_Minimum_Size.png] - *Placeholder for visual illustration of minimum acceptable logo size. The visual should show the logo at the minimum size for both web and print, clearly legible and recognizable.*)**
*   *Visual should show the logo at the minimum size for both web and print, clearly legible and recognizable.*

**1.5 Logo Do's and Don'ts:**

*   **Do's:**
    *   Use official EnergyPlug Autos logo files only.
    *   Maintain the logo's original proportions and aspect ratio.
    *   Ensure adequate clear space around the logo in all applications.
    *   Use approved logo color variations from the official brand color palette (Section 2).
    *   Use monochrome logo versions when color reproduction is limited or for single-color applications, ensuring good contrast.

*   **Don'ts:**
    *   Stretch, skew, distort, or rotate the logo in any way.
    *   Alter the logo's colors or add any additional colors outside the official brand palette, except for approved monochrome versions.
    *   Violate the minimum clear space requirements by placing other elements too close to the logo.
    *   Use outdated or unofficial logo versions.
    *   Place the logo on cluttered or visually distracting backgrounds that compromise legibility.
    *   Add drop shadows, outlines, bevels, or any other special effects to the logo.
    *   Animate the logo without specific brand-approved guidelines (generally discouraged).

**2. Color Palette**

The EnergyPlug Autos color palette is built upon shades of grey, black, and white to convey professionalism, reliability, and technical expertise. These colors should be used consistently across all brand communications.

**2.1 Primary Colors:**

*   **Dark Grey (Charcoal):** (Dominant Primary - Professionalism, Strength, Expertise)
    *   Hex: `#444444`
    *   RGB: `68, 68, 68`
    *   CMYK: `0, 0, 0, 73`
    *   Pantone: `432 C` (Closest Match)
    *   **Usage:** Primary background for sections, headings, strong visual elements. Represents core brand values of strength and expertise.

*   **Light Grey (Cool Grey):** (Dominant Primary - Modernity, Efficiency, Cleanliness)
    *   Hex: `#DDDDDD`
    *   RGB: `221, 221, 221`
    *   CMYK: `0, 0, 0, 13`
    *   Pantone: `Cool Gray 3 C` (Closest Match)
    *   **Usage:** Secondary background, content areas, supporting visual elements. Conveys a modern, efficient, and clean aesthetic.

*   **White:** (Supporting - Clarity, Precision, Neutrality)
    *   Hex: `#FFFFFF`
    *   RGB: `255, 255, 255`
    *   CMYK: `0, 0, 0, 0`
    *   Pantone: `White`
    *   **Usage:** Primary text color on dark backgrounds, clean backgrounds for contrast, and to create visual space.

*   **Black:** (Supporting - Authority, Reliability, Grounded Presence)
    *   Hex: `#000000`
    *   RGB: `0, 0, 0`
    *   CMYK: `0, 0, 0, 100`
    *   Pantone: `Black`
    *   **Usage:** Text color on light backgrounds, strong accents, and to emphasize key information with authority.

**2.2 Color Usage Guidelines:**

*   **Monochrome Dominance:** The EnergyPlug Autos brand is primarily monochrome.  Designs should predominantly utilize shades of grey, black, and white.
*   **Contrast for Legibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors for optimal legibility, especially online. Use darker greys or black text on light grey or white backgrounds, and vice versa.
*   **Subtle Variations:** Utilize different shades of grey to create visual hierarchy, depth, and subtle visual interest within the monochrome palette.
*   **Limited Accent Colors (Optional & Restrained):**  While the primary palette is monochrome, *very* restrained use of a single, muted cool accent color (e.g., a dark, desaturated blue or green) *could* be considered for interactive elements (buttons, links) or to highlight critical information.  However, overuse is strongly discouraged. If used, it should remain within the cool, desaturated family and complement the core grey/black/white palette without overpowering it.
*   **Avoid:** Bright, vibrant colors. Warm tones (reds, oranges, yellows). Any color that clashes with the professional, technical, and reliable brand image.

**3. Typography**

Typography is essential for conveying EnergyPlug Autos' brand personality. We utilize two carefully selected font families to establish clear visual hierarchy and ensure readability.

**3.1 Primary Font Family (Headings & Titles):**

*   **Font Name:**  **Roboto Slab** (or similar Slab Serif font like **Arvo**)
*   *Rationale:* A modern, strong slab serif font that conveys reliability, technical strength, and a slightly classic, American feel. Slab serifs project confidence and are highly legible for headings and titles.
*   **Weights:** **700 (Bold), 400 (Regular)**
*   **Usage:** Headings, subheadings, titles, and prominent display text. Use Bold weight for primary headings to draw attention and Regular weight for subheadings and secondary titles.

**3.2 Secondary Font Family (Body Text & Paragraphs):**

*   **Font Name:** **Roboto** (or similar Sans-Serif font like **Open Sans**, **Lato**)
*   *Rationale:* A highly readable and versatile sans-serif font optimized for body text and longer paragraphs. Roboto offers excellent legibility on screen and in print, ensuring comfortable reading experiences. Its clean, neutral style complements the strength of the slab serif headings.
*   **Weights:** **400 (Regular), 300 (Light)**
*   **Usage:** Body copy, paragraph text, captions, labels, form fields, and smaller text elements. Use Regular weight for standard body copy and Light weight for secondary text or areas where a softer visual hierarchy is desired.

**3.3 Typography Guidelines:**

*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Establish clear visual hierarchy by using Roboto Slab for headings and Roboto for body copy. Vary font sizes and weights to emphasize key information and guide the reader's eye.
*   **Legibility First:** Prioritize legibility above all else. Choose appropriate font sizes, line heights (leading), and letter spacing (tracking) to ensure comfortable and effortless reading, especially for online use. Minimum body text size on mobile should be 16px.
*   **Consistent Pairing:** Maintain consistent font pairing of Roboto Slab (Headings) and Roboto (Body Copy) across all brand materials to reinforce visual brand recognition.
*   **Web and Print Optimization:** Ensure both font families are well-optimized for both web and print environments for consistent rendering across platforms. Utilize web fonts for online applications and ensure proper font embedding for print materials.
*   **Strategic Emphasis (Font Weights & Styles):** Use bold weights of Roboto Slab to emphasize key headlines and calls to action. Use italics sparingly and only for specific text elements like captions or quotes within body copy (using Roboto). Avoid overuse of bold or italic styles.

**4. Imagery Style**

EnergyPlug Autos' imagery style should be professional, authentic, and technically focused, reflecting our expertise in mechanical engineering and vehicle repair.

**4.1 Photography:**

*   **Style:** Professional, high-quality, authentic, and technically focused. Avoid generic stock photos. Prioritize photography that feels genuine, reliable, and showcases expertise.
*   **Subjects:**
    *   **Mechanics at Work:** Images of skilled technicians inspecting, diagnosing, and repairing vehicles, machinery, and light trucks. Focus on hands-on work, use of tools, and professional service bays.
    *   **Equipment & Tools:** Clean, well-lit images of specialized diagnostic equipment, repair tools, and machinery components, highlighting precision and technical capabilities.
    *   **Vehicles & Machinery (American, German, European, Asian):** Showcase a variety of vehicles and machinery types that EnergyPlug Autos services. Focus on clean, well-maintained examples.
    *   **Workshop/Service Bay Environment:** Images of a clean, organized, and professional workshop or service bay environment, conveying efficiency and attention to detail.
*   **Tone:** Professional, reliable, competent, and trustworthy. Imagery should instill confidence in EnergyPlug Autos' expertise and service quality.
*   **Color:**  Imagery should generally align with the brand's monochrome palette or utilize natural, realistic colors. Avoid overly saturated or heavily filtered images.

**4.2 Illustration & Graphics:**

*   **Style:** Clean, minimalist, technical, and geometric. Illustrations should be used sparingly and purposefully to enhance clarity and visual communication.
*   **Color Palette:** Strictly adhere to the brand color palette. Primarily use shades of grey, black, and white for illustrations.
*   **Types & Applications:**
    *   **Line Icons:** Use clean, consistent line icons to represent services, features, or benefits. Maintain a consistent style and weight for all icons. Consider icons related to vehicles, tools, mechanics, inspections, etc.
    *   **Technical Diagrams (Optional):** Simple, clean technical diagrams or schematics could be used sparingly to illustrate complex mechanical concepts or processes, if relevant and appropriate.

**4.3 Iconography:**

*   **Style:** Clean, minimalist line icons, consistent with the overall brand aesthetic. Icons should be geometric, modern, and easily recognizable. Avoid overly ornate or detailed icons.
*   **Weight:** Maintain a consistent, thin line weight across all icons in the set.
*   **Color:** Use brand-approved monochrome colors for icons: light grey, dark grey, or black, depending on context and background color to ensure visibility and contrast.
*   **Purpose:** Utilize icons to enhance navigation, improve user experience, and highlight key services or features. Ensure icons are used purposefully and contribute to clarity and usability.
